# PracticeProjects
Holds the projects I worked on to help me learn

Simple Calcuator - Made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript while following a tutorial on section.io. It is able to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. This project was to help me famialize myself with JavaScript.

Guessing Game - A small game made using Python that lets a user guess the number or try to get the program to guess the user's number. This project was to help me refresh my memory of Python syntax.
